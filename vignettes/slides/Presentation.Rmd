## Introduction

The WRTA route and stop configuration is selected in a manual manner

The purpose of this project is to prove that geospatial analysis using R
can provide unique insights into the functioning of transit systems.


## Data

The vast majority of our data is derived from WRTA reports, TIGER shapefiles, and 
census data. Some examples can be seen below.

```


## Methods

Our methodology is fairly straight forward. For this project we have four 
deliverables. They are:

- Population Density Map
- Traffic Count Map
- Categorization of Ridership Map
- Routes above maximum subsidy
